# Repository for the generation of multitemporal multifactor corridor networks (M2CoNet)
The generation of M2CoNet requires several steps:
1. Generation of cost surfaces (for which the GEE code is provided)
2. Generation of cost distance rasters from user-defined points using the knitghts move algorithm
3. Raster normalisation
4. Raster cells stats to join all distance rasters

While the GEE code is provided code for all other steps will be provided during the following weeks

## Generation of cost surfaces
